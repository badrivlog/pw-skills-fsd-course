        I have added three hyperlinks to the website. These links are designed
        to navigate users to different pages within the site. The main
        navigation menu includes the following sections: <strong>Home</strong>,
        <strong>Web Development</strong> and <strong>Web Design</strong>. Each
        of these links directs to a specific page that provides detailed content
        related to the respective topic.

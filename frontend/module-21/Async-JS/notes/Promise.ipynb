        "Promises are an important concept in modern Javascript programming. They allow us to handle asynchronous\n",
        "code and make it more efficient and responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Javascript is single-threaded`, it can execute only one code statement at a time. Some pieces of code execute\n",
        "immediately and some take time. The operation of fetching data from the server is not instantaneous. In that\n",
        "case, the execution thread would be blocked, leading to a bad user experience due to slow loading. We can\n",
        "solve these problems through Promises.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be available at some point\n",
        "in the future. Promises are a way of handling asynchronous code, which means code that runs in the\n",
        "background while another code is executing. With promises, we can write code that waits for the completion of\n",
        "an asynchronous task before moving on to the next task.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importance of Javascript promises\n",
        "Before looking into the implementation of promises it is important to know the importance of promises.\n",
        "Here are some of the reasons why promises are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Promises are an **effective way to handle asynchronous code in Javascript.**\n",

        "\n",
        "* In one of the previous lectures, we looked into callback hell, where multiple nested callbacks make code\n",

        "code than traditional callback functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Promises can be chained together to handle multiple asynchronous tasks in a more readable and\n",
        "manageable way. This can lead to more efficient and maintainable code, making it easier to debug and\n",
        "improve over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Promises come with an inbuilt error-handling mechanism, we can handle both expected and unexpected\n",
        "errors in a consistent way. This makes it easier to identify and debug errors in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Promises are widely used. This means that developers can use promises in their code regardless of the\n",
        "libraries or frameworks they are using.\n",

        "promise goes to the **REJECTED** state.\n",

        "the response is received, there are two possible cases:\n",
